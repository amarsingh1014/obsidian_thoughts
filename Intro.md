## Poles

A **pole** of a function 𝑓(𝑧) is a point 𝑧=𝑧0 where the function becomes unbounded or infinite. It's a singularity where the function behaves like 1/(𝑧−𝑧0)^𝑛​, where 𝑛n is a positive integer.

### Representation

- **Graphical**: Visual representation on the complex plane showing the point where the function becomes infinite.
F- **Mathematical**: 𝑓(𝑧)=𝑔(𝑧)/(𝑧−𝑧0)𝑛f(z)=(z−z0​)^n​, where 𝑔(𝑧0) is finite and 𝑛n is a positive integer.

## Singularities

A **singularity** of a function is a point where the function behaves in an unusual manner. It includes poles and other types of singularities.

### Essential Singularities

An **essential singularity** is a point where a function behaves unpredictably. For example, 𝑒^1/𝑧​ has an essential singularity at 𝑧=0.

### Non-Essential Singularities

A **non-essential singularity** is a point where a function behaves predictably. It includes poles, removable singularities, and algebraic singularities.

### Representation

- **Graphical**: Differentiate between essential and non-essential singularities on the complex plane.
- **Mathematical**: Use function representations to classify singularities, such as 𝑓(𝑧)=1/(𝑧−𝑧0)^n  for poles and 𝑓(𝑧)=1/𝑧−𝑧0​ for removable singularities.

## Additional Notes

- Poles and singularities are crucial concepts in complex analysis, often used to understand the behavior of functions in the complex plane.
- They play a significant role in the study of complex integration, residue theory, and the behavior of functions near singular points.
